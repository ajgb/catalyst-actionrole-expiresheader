NAME
    Catalyst::ActionRole::ExpiresHeader - Set default Expires header for
    actions

SYNOPSIS
        package MyApp::Controller::Foo;

        BEGIN { extends 'Catalyst::Controller'; }

        with 'Catalyst::TraitFor::Controller::ActionRole' => {
            action_roles => ['ExpiresHeader'],
        };

        sub expire_in_one_day : Local Expires('+1d') { ... }

        sub already_expired : Local Expires('-1d') { ... }

DESCRIPTION
    Provides a ActionRole to set HTTP Expires header for actions, which will
    be set unless Expires header was already set.

    Argument syntax matches the "-expires" from
    "CREATING_A_STANDARD_HTTP_HEADER:" in CGI.

SEE ALSO
    Take a look at Catalyst::ActionRole::NotCacheableHeaders to make your
    action not cachable by default.
